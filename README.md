# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my implementation of the software projects for the **Nand2Tetris** course (Building a Modern Computer from First Principles).

## Project Structure

### Project 6: The Assembler (Java)
* **Language:** Java
* **Goal:** Translates Hack assembly language (`.asm`) into binary machine code (`.hack`).
* **Key Concepts:** Symbol table management, parsing logic, binary conversion.

### Project 7: VM Translator - Part I (Python)
* **Language:** Python
* **Goal:** Builds the first part of the Virtual Machine translator (stack arithmetic and memory access).
* **Key Concepts:** Stack manipulation, memory segments, intermediate code generation.

### Project 8: VM Translator - Part II (Python)
* **Language:** Python
* **Goal:** Completes the VM translator by adding program flow and function calling commands.
* **Key Concepts:** Branching (`label`, `goto`, `if-goto`), function definition, and return logic.
